# BungeeBridge
## A plugin combo to allow spigot to talk to bungee and execute commands as the player on bungeecord

### How is this useful?
* You can make GUIs on spigot-side that let your players run /server commands to connect to servers.
* If you are using a custom queue plugin like ajQueue, you can make the GUI use that instead of force connecting, which can result in the player attempting to connect while the server is offline and receiving a warning you cannot control.
* If you need to set up Vulcan or another anticheat to ban players from the proxy

### Okay, how do I install it?
1. Download the BungeeCommandExecutor in the releases tab or compile it from the source code. Put this one in the **SPIGOT** side.
2. Download the BungeeCommandSender in the releases tab or compile it. Put this one in the **BUNGEE / WATERFALL** side.
